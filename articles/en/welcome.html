        <p><b><u>Bienvenue</u></b></p>
        <p>
            With 15 years of unwavering commitment to the world of video games, my career trajectory has taken me from the
            hallowed grounds of indie ventures to collaborating with industry giants on high-stakes AAA projects. It's a
            passion that ignites within me—a relentless pursuit of innovation amidst complex challenges and an unyielding
            desire to work alongside extraordinary minds in crafting some of the most iconic titles our industry has ever
            seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            My odyssey began with SAP consultancy, but after half a decade spent navigating this world, I found myself drawn
            back to academia for my Master's degree in Video Games Programming. This pursuit wasn't unfamiliar—AI had always
            captivated me since those early days of study—and though I originally commenced my career as a generalist
            programmer or tools developer, destiny guided me towards the ever-evolving landscape of AI within gaming.
        </p>
        <p>
            My tenure at VRally4 was particularly transformative; there, I harnessed genetic algorithms to autonomously adjust
            parameters for our AI-controlled vehicles—a breakthrough that proved invaluable during my work on CP77 and beyond.
            It's this blend of creativity and technical prowess that has defined my career path thus far.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a seasoned professional, I bring to the table an extensive skill set capable of traversing the entire gamut of
            development—from sparking ideas into tangible prototypes to overseeing intricate production processes. My
            expertise lies in forging partnerships with design teams to turn visions into reality, meticulously planning and
            executing project tasks while crafting efficient code that's both robust and reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
            My approach is marked by a steadfast dedication to delivering exceptional outcomes; I hold myself accountable to
            my commitments while maintaining an unwaayering vigilance over each phase of the development cycle, offering
            insightful critiques that elevate our collective work. In essence, my career reflects not just individual
            achievements but a testament to collaboration and mentorship within the gaming community—a legacy I am eager to
            continue building upon with every project we undertake together.
